# Deep Drawer

<BlockImage id="deep_drawers" scale="8" />

Deep Drawer is a massive storage system designed to contain items that are normally non-stackable, such as armor, tools, and weapons. Unlike standard chests, this drawer can store enormous quantities of non-stackable items.

## Key Features

- **Massive Capacity**: Can store up to 50k unique non-stackable items (configurable)
- **Break Protection**: Cannot be broken when it contains items. You must use a dolly or similar items from other mods to move it!

## Use Cases

- **Non-Stackable Item Storage**: Perfect for storing enchanted items, tools, weapons, armor, and other items that don't stack
- **Item Insertion**: You can insert items directly into the drawer, or use the Deep Drawer Extender module to allow hoppers, transport pipes, and other automation systems to automatically insert items
- **Item Extraction**: Requires the Deep Drawer Extractor module to automatically extract items from the drawer
- **Storage Mod Integration**: Requires Deep Drawer Interface module to integrate with storage mods like Applied Energistics 2, Refined Storage 2, and Tom's Storage

## Additional Modules

Deep Drawer can be extended with several modules that enhance its functionality. All modules also function as Extenders, allowing hoppers and pipes to insert items into the drawer:

- **Deep Drawer Extender**: Extends the drawer's presence, allowing hoppers and pipes to insert items into the drawer
- **Deep Drawer Extractor**: Required for extracting items from the drawer. Automatically extracts items based on advanced filters
- **Deep Drawer Interface**: Required for integration with storage mods like Tom's Storage, Applied Energistics 2, and Refined Storage 2
