# Deep Drawer Interface

<BlockImage id="deep_drawer_interface" scale="8" />

The Deep Drawer Interface is a module that allows the Deep Drawer to interact with storage systems from other mods. It acts as a bridge between your Deep Drawer and advanced storage networks.

**Important Warning**: While the Interface can be used with item pipes, it's not recommended for extraction as it can cause TPS lag. Use the Deep Drawer Extractor instead for optimized extraction.

## Key Features

- **Storage Mod Integration**: Connects with storage mods like Tom's Storage, Applied Energistics 2, and Refined Storage 2
- **Full Access**: Allows both insertion and extraction of items from the drawer
- **Item Insertion**: You can insert items directly into the drawer through the Interface
- **Network Discovery**: Automatically finds the drawer through connected modules up to 16 blocks away

## Use Cases

- **Storage Network Integration**: Connect your Deep Drawer to AE2 or RS2 networks to access non-stackable items from your storage system
- **Centralized Storage**: View and manage Deep Drawer contents through your main storage network interface
- **Automation**: Integrate Deep Drawer contents with your existing storage automation systems
